# contest-helpers
Collection of codes of common algorithms and data structures that can be helpful in online contests.

This is a repository made for the purpose for help in online contests where speed matters.Contest on codeforces and codechef often require data structeres like segment trees,tries.Most of the times we cannot code complex data structures and algorithm from memory. 

In these cases we look online for sample codes or search for similar problems. This takes up lot of our time which we cannot afford. 

I have made this repo to help me during contests.Codes commited will be mine which I may have implemented during practice or contests on various online judges.
